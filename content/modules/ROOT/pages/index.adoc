In the ever-evolving landscape of information technology (IT), containers have emerged as a fundamental component that revolutionizes software development, deployment, and management. These lightweight and portable units encapsulate applications, their dependencies, and even the underlying operating system. However, as containers have become pervasive in IT, operating system customization remains a persistent challenge, both in the context of day two configuration management and during the initial creation of operating system (OS) images.

In this lab you will learn how to evolve your containers into full fledged operating systems.
